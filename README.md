# CFG-Reactapp

This is a react app created as a part of 24 hour hackathon Code for good organized by Jp Morgan.

This app is made according to the problem statement curated by Daksha Ngo.

It is a React application to connect paramedics requests with the service provider. The paramedics fill in the patients information and create requests for the services and service provider is able to see those requests and accept or reject the request based on the availability of the resources.

To run application on your system follow the steps meticulously:

1. Fork the repo in your github remote repo
2. Clone the repo.

in your terminal run the following commands:
1. $ git clone (url of the cloned code)
2. open vs code / text editor.

it will open as a folder named Team42...inside that in the terminal 
1. do npm install (to isntall all the dependencies)

do cd client in the terminal.

in client folder run the command:
npm install

you have installed all the dependencies.

Now do cd .. to get to Team 42 folder in the terminal.

run command --  node server.js (so the server starts)

do cd client and in the client folder run command--

npm start ( to strat the app locally)

--Voila! you have the application running.ðŸ˜Š
